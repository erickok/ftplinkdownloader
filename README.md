While Android itself and any common browser supports downlaoding of http:// links to your device, no support for FTP exists. This app supports basic easy downloading of FTP-hosted files by responding to ftp:// or ftps:// scheme links clicked in any app.

  - Plain FTP and secure FTPS (aka FTP-ES and FTP-SSL) supported
  - Username/password authentication support
